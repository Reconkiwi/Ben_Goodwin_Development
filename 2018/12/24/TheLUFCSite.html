This meant that I would be the only developer, and as the designs for the new site had been completed, it was up to me to work on development solely. Alex did also suggest that I could slightly alter the designs if I felt the need to do so. This was extremely beneficial to me as I personally like to have some input on the front-end design of development.</h6>

<h2 id="initial-problems-and-solutions">Initial Problems and Solutions</h2>
<h6 id="there-were-two-main-initial-problems-before-development-firstly-i-had-never-developed-using-wordpress-before-therefore-i-had-a-fairly-steep-learning-curve-to-take-into-account-so-that-i-could-manage-my-time-accordingly-and-i-would-need-to-read-a-few-tutorials-or-speak-to-a-wordpress-specialist-on-my-course-as-well-to-ensure-i-fully-understood-the-wordpress-theme-development-secondly-having-looked-through-the-code-of-alexs-original-theme-i-felt-that-it-wouldnt-be-possible-to-rebuild-the-site-based-off-of-his-theme-this-meant-that-i-needed-to-discuss-building-a-new-theme-from-scratch-with-alex-as-well-as-needing-to-find-the-quickest-possible-solution-to-building-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch-for-this-i-needed-to-come-up-with-a-series-of-ideas">There were two main initial problems before development. Firstly, I had never developed using WordPress before, therefore, I had a fairly steep learning curve to take into account so that I could manage my time accordingly and I would need to read a few tutorials or speak to a WordPress specialist on my course as well to ensure I fully understood the WordPress theme development. Secondly, having looked through the code of Alex’s original theme I felt that it wouldn’t be possible to rebuild the site based off of his theme. This meant that I needed to discuss building a new theme from scratch with Alex as well as needing to find the quickest possible solution to building a WordPress theme from scratch. For this I needed to come up with a series of ideas:</h6>

<h2 id="idea-1---building-pages-and-directories-from-scratch">Idea 1 - Building Pages and Directories from Scratch</h2>

<h6 id="initially-i-had-considered-creating-the-pages-configurations-and-directories-from-scratch-this-would-have-meant-that-i-would-have-a-better-understanding-of-wordpress-systems-and-setup-as-well-as-this-it-would-mean-that-all-of-the-code-on-the-theme-would-be-mine-which-would-help-with-development-further-down-the-line-as-everything-would-be-setup-in-the-same-format">Initially I had considered creating the pages, configurations and directories from scratch. This would have meant that I would have a better understanding of WordPress’ systems and setup. As well as this it would mean that all of the code on the theme would be mine which would help with development further down the line as everything would be setup in the same format.</h6>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-1">Problems With Idea 1</h2>
<h6 id="the-main-issue-that-i-faced-with-this-idea-was-the-time-that-it-would-take-me-to-get-a-blank-wordpress-theme-up-and-running-alex-was-hoping-to-see-progress-within-the-first-two-weeks-of-development-which-meant-that-i-didnt-have-a-large-window-to-get-some-of-the-pages-completed">The main issue that i faced with this idea was the time that it would take me to get a blank WordPress theme up and running. Alex was hoping to see progress within the first two weeks of development which meant that I didn’t have a large window to get some of the pages completed.</h6>

<h2 id="idea-2---a-course-mates-blank-template">Idea 2 - A Course Mates Blank Template</h2>

<h6 id="the-second-idea-was-to-build-the-site-using-a-course-mates-blank-wordpress-theme-the-benefits-to-this-being-that-the-blank-template-was-being-used-commercially-already-therefore-i-was-aware-of-the-templates-potential-as-i-could-see-how-it-had-been-implemented-into-many-sites">The second idea was to build the site using a course mates blank WordPress theme. The benefits to this being that the blank template was being used commercially already, therefore, I was aware of the templates potential as I could see how it had been implemented into many sites.</h6>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-2">Problems With Idea 2</h2>
<h6 id="the-downside-to-this-idea-was-that-the-blank-template-needed-to-be-reformatted-to-ensure-that-it-was-not-breaching-any-of-the-themes-licensing-agreements-this-would-have-taken-quite-a-lot-of-time-and-would-have-potentially-caused-more-problems-rather-than-solve-any">The downside to this idea was that the blank template needed to be reformatted to ensure that it was not breaching any of the themes licensing agreements. This would have taken quite a lot of time and would have potentially caused more problems rather than solve any.</h6>

<h2 id="idea-3---bones-theme">Idea 3 - Bones Theme</h2>

<p><img src="http://metrik.space/assets/bones.jpg" alt="Bones Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<h6 id="the-third-idea-was-to-look-into-using-the-bones-wordpress-theme-bones-is-a-html5-mobile-first-blank-theme-used-for-rapid-development-bones-also-came-with-a-free-license-meaning-that-i-could-use-it-for-alexs-site-free-of-charge">The third idea was to look into using the Bones WordPress theme. Bones is a HTML5, mobile first, blank theme used for rapid development. Bones also came with a free license meaning that I could use it for Alex’s site free of charge</h6>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-3">Problems With Idea 3</h2>
<h6 id="my-biggest-problem-with-bones-was-that-i-couldnt-get-on--with-the-documentation-this-was-a-really-large-issue-for-me-considering-my-lack-of-knowledge-in-wordpress-development">My biggest problem with Bones was that I couldn’t get on  with the documentation. This was a really large issue for me considering my lack of knowledge in Wordpress development.</h6>

<h2 id="idea-4---underscores-theme">Idea 4 - Underscores theme</h2>
<p><img src="http://metrik.space/assets/underscores.png" alt="Underscores Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<h6 id="having-looked-into-various-solutions-to-my-problem-and-still-being-unsatisfied-with-my-options-a-masters-student-suggested-underscores-to-me-underscores-is-a-little-like-bones-however-it-aims-to-use-minimal-css-which-allows-for-developers-to-tear-the-base-theme-apart-and-completely-rebuild-it-from-the-ground-up-as-well-as-this-underscores-comes-with-a-ready-to-go-translation-package-and-custom-404-pages-to-help-get-developers-started">Having looked into various solutions to my problem, and still being unsatisfied with my options, a masters student suggested Underscores to me. Underscores is a little like Bones, however, it aims to use minimal CSS which allows for developers to tear the base theme apart and completely rebuild it from the ground up. As well as this Underscores comes with a ready to go translation package and custom 404 pages to help get developers started.</h6>

<h2 id="the-final-solution">The Final Solution</h2>
<h6 id="i-ended-up-opting-for-underscores-rather-than-any-of-the-other-options-this-was-mainly-due-to-the-large-amounts-of-documentation-and-tutorials-based-around-the-theme-i-felt-that-this-would-be-really-beneficial-to-me-as-i-could-use-these-to-increase-my-development-efficiency">I ended up opting for Underscores rather than any of the other options, this was mainly due to the large amounts of documentation and tutorials based around the theme. I felt that this would be really beneficial to me as I could use these to increase my development efficiency.</h6>

<h6 id="once-i-had-decided-on-my-plan-of-action-for-the-wordpress-theme-development-i-decided-to-breakdown-the-project-into-the-main-tasks-i-needed-to-complete-these-are-as-follows">Once I had decided on my plan of action for the WordPress theme development. I decided to breakdown the project into the main tasks I needed to complete. These are as follows:</h6>

<h2 id="the-breakdown">The Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Base Wordpress Theme</li>
  <li>Displaying Client Created Posts</li>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>User Chat System</li>
  <li>Fully Customisable Pages</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="having-taken-a-look-at-the-breakdown-of-the-project-it-was-clear-that-i-would-need-to-somehow-setup-the-wordpress-theme-with-editable-text-sections-for-alex-so-that-he-could-fully-customise-the-content-of-the-site-as-well-as-this-it-was-clear-to-me-that-both-the-user-login-systems-and-the-chat-system-would-be-the-last-jobs-on-the-list-even-though-they-would-most-likely-be-the-hardest-to-setup-this-was-because-alex-wanted-to-see-weekly-updates-on-the-progress-of-the-website-and-i-wanted-him-to-feel-satisfied-after-each-weekly-meeting">Having taken a look at the breakdown of the project, it was clear that I would need to somehow setup the Wordpress theme with editable text sections for Alex so that he could fully customise the content of the site. As well as this it was clear to me that both the user login systems and the chat system would be the last jobs on the list, even though they would most likely be the hardest to setup. This was because Alex wanted to see weekly updates on the progress of the website and I wanted him to feel satisfied after each weekly meeting.</h6>

<h6 id="having-scheduled-these-tasks-accordingly-i-organised-a-preliminary-meeting-with-alex-to-discuss-my-plans-and-ensure-that-he-was-happy-for-me-to-crack-on-with-development">Having scheduled these tasks accordingly I organised a preliminary meeting with Alex to discuss my plans and ensure that he was happy for me to crack on with development.</h6>

Alex seemed pleased with my scheduling tactics, however, he wanted me to grasp the importance of our audience within the website. Therefore, I decided to do some research into the main groups of people that we were trying to target with the rebrand. My research is as follows:</h6>

However, since the rebrand of the social media platforms, followers had been on the rise. It was important that the site helped to retain this community by creating a platform for followers to discuss their thoughts on the club and entice more people to get involved with the discussions.</h6>

<h3 id="leeds-united-fans">Leeds United Fans</h3>

<h6 id="for-a-team-that-hasnt-been-a-part-of-the-premiership-since-2004-leeds-united-have-been-regarded-by-sky-sports-2019-as-the-12th-largest-club-in-england-regarding-their-50-year-average-league-position-with-an-average-home-attendance-of-25123-this-season-20th-in-england-with-numbers-like-these-and-leeds-united-on-the-rise-towards-promotion-from-the-championship-there-is-a-lot-of-room-for-alex-to-grow-lufc-news-into-a-much-larger-community">For a team that hasn’t been a part of the Premiership since 2004, Leeds United have been regarded by Sky Sports (2019) as the 12th largest club in England (regarding their 50-year average league position) with an average home attendance of 25,123 this season (20th in England). With numbers like these and Leeds United on the rise towards promotion from the championship, there is a lot of room for Alex to grow LUFC News into a much larger community.</h6>

<h6 id="as-well-as-this-leeds-fans-have-become-frustrated-with-the-lack-of-coverage-their-team-receives-therefore-with-the-right-rebrand-alex-could-pull-fans-away-from-sky-and-towards-lufc-news-the-important-thing-to-consider-with-the-rebuild-of-the-website-was-clearly-the-user-experience-as-well-as-this-it-was-important-that-the-site-reflected-the-leeds-united-brand-with-its-design-and-content">As well as this Leeds fans have become frustrated with the lack of coverage their team receives. Therefore, with the right rebrand Alex could pull fans away from Sky and towards LUFC News. The important thing to consider with the rebuild of the website was clearly the user experience. As well as this it was important that the site reflected the Leeds United brand with its design and content.</h6>

It was important that he could see that LUFC News was a professional organisation that created its community purely for the fans. Andrea would be the final step to pushing LUFC News from a small organisation to a worldwide community, therefore, it was imperative that he was impressed by what we had created.</h6>

However, I was unclear on what these were used for before development started.

As seen in the code I simply created an array that posted the primary-menu (menu-1) into the page and then styled it afterwards to display across a bar at the top of the page. As well as this I used a simple JQuery function to hide the menu when on mobile and display a simple fontawesome hamburger menu. This was an extremely simple function that I found within the underscores generated blank theme, however, I plan on changing this to something slightly animated and more stylised for the sites launch on the 3rd January.</h6>
