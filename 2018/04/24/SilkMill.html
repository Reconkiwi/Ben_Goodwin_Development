The photos would then be deleted to save space on the system.</h6>

As well as this the idea didnt offer visitors the chance to evaluate their experience which was a specification set by the mill.</h6>

<h2 id="idea-2---rfid">Idea 2 - RFID</h2>

<h6 id="our-second-idea-was-to-develop-an-rfid-system-where-upon-entry-visitors-would-be-given-an-rfid-card-with-predetermined-information-on-it-such-as-age-range-or-gender-as-visitors-walked-around-the-silk-mill-they-would-be-able-to-scan-their-cards-and-begin-interactive-experiences-or-restart-videos-that-were-already-playing-each-scan-on-their-card-would-send-data-to-a-database-that-collected-information-about-the-various-exhibits-they-had-been-to-as-well-as-the-predefined-information-already-on-the-card">Our second idea was to develop an RFID system where, upon entry, visitors would be given an RFID card with predetermined information on it such as age range or gender. As visitors walked around the silk mill, they would be able to scan their cards and begin interactive experiences or restart videos that were already playing. Each scan on their card would send data to a database that collected information about the various exhibits they had been to as well as the predefined information already on the card.</h6>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-2">Problems With Idea 2</h2>

As well as this, we decided that it would be difficult to precisely predefine information on an RFID card for each person that visited.</h6>

<h2 id="idea-3---mobile-app">Idea 3 - Mobile App</h2>

Visitors would be asked at the beginning of the application to fill out a short survey to help the silk mill to gather data. Having done this, visitors would then gain access to exclusive virtual content about each exhibition. by clicking each exhibition tile on the application, information would be sent to a database where silk mill voulenteers would be able to see the amount of times each exhibit was attended per visitor.</h6>

Theoretically, this would have been a really interesting way to implement our web application, however, the system would only work if we had access to multiple programmed Rasberry Pi tablets rather than just one. This is because Whitchurch Silk Mill has a multitude of visitors throughout a day (24,000 a year) and would likely require multiple tablets to satisfy their capacity.</h6>

<h6 id="as-well-as-this-the-development-costs-of-creating-rasberry-pi-touchscreens-would-cost-around-Â120-for-each-device-this-outcome-would-be-very-costly-for-us-as-well-as-the-client">As well as this the development costs of creating Rasberry Pi touchscreens would cost around Â£120 for each device. This outcome would be very costly for us as well as the client.</h6>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

Having said this, after our discussion with the client, it was clear that developing the Rasberry Pi mobile devices was unfeasable. Instead of this we decided to develop our application as a web app hosted on a private network that would be accessible to any silk mill visitors with a SMART phone. We felt that this was a good remedy for the situation and also made the system more accessible for visitors.</h6>

<h2 id="target-audiences">Target Audiences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Visitors</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="lisa-suggested-that-one-of-the-main-audiences-for-our-project-were-the-people-visiting-the-silk-mill-to-satisfy-this-audience-it-was-key-that-we-developed-our-web-application-to-be-easy-and-simple-to-use-making-it-accessible-for-anyone-that-may-want-to-use-it-as-well-as-this-our-proposed-solution-requires-user-input-so-that-whitchurch-silk-mill-can-gather-data-successfully-this-meant-that-the-system-needed-to-have-a-good-incentive-to-be-used">Lisa suggested that one of the main audiences for our project were the people visiting the silk mill. To satisfy this audience it was key that we developed our web application to be easy and simple to use, making it accessible for anyone that may want to use it. As well as this, our proposed solution requires user input so that Whitchurch Silk Mill can gather data successfully. This meant that the system needed to have a good incentive to be used.</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Volunteers</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="another-target-audience-that-we-needed-to-consider-were-the-volunteers-at-the-silk-mill-as-one-of-their-roles-is-to-assess-the-data-gathered-from-the-virtual-guide-it-was-important-that-we-visualised-the-data-in-an-aesthetically-pleasing-manner-as-a-solution-to-this-we-decided-to-develop-a-live-updating-infographic-webpage-to-present-the-data-we-felt-that-this-would-make-it-far-easier-for-silk-mill-volunteers-to-find-trends-and-statistics-in-the-data">Another target audience that we needed to consider were the volunteers at the silk mill. As one of their roles is to assess the data gathered from the virtual guide, it was important that we visualised the data in an aesthetically pleasing manner. As a solution to this, we decided to develop a live-updating infographic webpage to present the data. We felt that this would make it far easier for silk mill volunteers to find trends and statistics in the data.</h6>

<h6 id="another-feature-of-importance-to-the-volunteers-was-ensuring-that-the-data-being-collected-was-well-protected-and-could-only-be-safely-accessed-by-them-as-they-were-collecting-some-pieces-of-private-information-from-their-visitors-such-as-gender-age-and-postcode-it-was-important-that-this-data-remain-confidential-this-is-something-we-took-into-account-during-development">Another feature of importance to the volunteers was ensuring that the data being collected was well protected and could only be safely accessed by them. As they were collecting some pieces of private information from their visitors such as gender, age and postcode, it was important that this data remain confidential. This is something we took into account during development.</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Heritage Lottery Fund</li>
</ul>

As Whitchurch Silk Mill needed to show evidence of how the HLF’s investment was improving the popularity, accessibility and maintenance of the mill, it was important that we captured valuable information and statistics from our virtual guide. As well as this the main data that we wanted to show the HLF needed to be eye-catching and easy to read, so that Whitchurch Silk Mill could impress them with the progress they have made with their investment.</h6>

Thanks to Jacks mathmatics, we have estimated that if all 24,000 of Whitchurch Silk Mill’s signed up to the virtual tour guide, the database would require around 768MB of space per year. As well as this the application files would take up around 350KB of space. To cater for the space required by the database and application we proposed a 500GB hardrive that usually has a market value of around Â£40.</h6>

This would be more than enough space for the silk mill.</h6>

<h6 id="another-thing-that-we-needed-to-consider-was-the-limitations-of-how-many-visitors-could-connect-to-the-rasbjerry-pi-at-one-time-as-we-were-unsure-of-how-the-system-would-react-to-multiple-users-it-was-up-to-us-to-stress-test-the-system-and-log-the-effects">Another thing that we needed to consider was the limitations of how many visitors could connect to the Rasbjerry Pi at one time.

  <li>Stage 1: Discuss our proposed solutions with the client and determine which is most viable. Carry out further research into the proposed solution.</li>
  <li>Stage 2: Breakdown the development process and set a clear strategy for the creation of the system. Once complete begin the development process.</li>
  <li>Stage 3: Continue with the development of the project and aim to have complete a semi-functional prototype by the end of this stage.</li>
  <li>Stage 4: Begin to test and improve aspects of the first prototype while adding additional features and bug fixes.</li>
  <li>Stage 5: Finalise the prototype ready fo the final presentation ensuring it is bug free and ready for a live demonstration.</li>
  <li>Stage 6: Prepare all documentation, code, and hardware, ready for hand off to the client.</li>

However, it was noticed that I had not developed a redirectory system for my evaluation system. This meant that users could directly bypass the login page and have full access to the data collected through our application. I was extremely glad that this was pointed out as it was something that I had overlooked during my development.</h6>

No matter how i tried to gain access to the page I would always be redirected back to the login page. I think that this really strengthened the safeguarding system I had in place. With this system now in place, and more time left to experiment with the project, I decided to have a look at other areas I could strengthen.</h6>

After some experimenting, I decided to edit Jack’s form system on the virtual tour guide as well as the database so that the user could pick from a series of age groups rather than write their exact age. I then set the database age row to ‘VARCHAR’ instead of an integer so that the data would display properly. This made the age graph look far more polished and Jack was happy with the changes that I made</h6>

Although learning new softwares and coding languages was challenging at times, I believe that I have learnt large amount about developing back-end softwares. I think that myself and Jack worked extremely well as a team and helped each other to learn for the duration of the project. In terms of the goals that I had at the start of the project, I believe that I have achieved all but one of them. To complete final goal we will need to discuss the project with Zoe at the end of year show.</h6>
