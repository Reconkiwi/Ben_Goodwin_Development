This semester, I wanted to test my development skills in an area of industry that I had a key interest in pursuing as well as working on something that I would really enjoy. I decided to focus my development work on something interactive, therefore, I chose to build a project using one of the game engines such as Unity3D or Unreal.</h6>

It was an interactive HoloLens experience about the functions of the heart and the processes that happen within it. As i hadn’t picked up the HoloLens since then, I decided it would be fun to work on one last project with it before I finished university.</h6>

For this reason, I decided to build a game for it. Because of this, I chose to work with the Unity3D game engine as you can build directly for HoloLens with it using Visual Studio. More on that later!</h6>

In 2017 Gartner predicted that 100 million customers will shop using augmented reality. To back this theory up Apple, have released their new web reality named quick view AR in the last year which has easy implementation into any online store as long as the customer has an iPhone.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">Target Audience</h2>

<h3 id="industry-professionals">Industry Professionals</h3>

<h6 id="firstly-as-i-was-coming-towards-the-end-of-my-studies-at-the-university-of-winchester-it-was-important-that-my-final-project-was-focussed-towards-professionals-in-the-industry-that-i-wish-to-work-in-in-the-future-therefore-the-project-needed-to-be-impressive-polished-and-show-off-a-wide-range-of-skills">Firstly, as I was coming towards the end of my studies at the University of Winchester, it was important that my final project was focussed towards professionals in the industry that I wish to work in in the future. Therefore, the project needed to be impressive, polished and show off a wide range of skills.</h6>

<h3 id="attendees-of-the-end-of-year-show">Attendees of the End of Year show</h3>

As the attendance would be a mix of professionals, students and passersby, it was important that the project no only wowed the users but was also really easy to ‘pick up and play’ as some people would not have much time to take part in the interactive experience and others would need teaching on how to use the device.</h6>

<h3 id="the-lecturers">The Lecturers</h3>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 1: Holo Music Visualiser</h3>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/musicvis.jpg" alt="Holo Visualiser" /></p>

<h6 id="the-mixed-reality-music-visualiser-was-an-idea-i-came-up-with-that-would-essentially-create-a-floating-orb-in-a-real-world-surrounding-using-the-hololens-that-morphed-its-shape-to-the-bpm-beats-per-minute-of-a-song-the-idea-was-really-simple-and-would-have-been-really-fun-to-work-on">The mixed reality music visualiser was an idea I came up with that would essentially create a floating orb in a real world surrounding using the HoloLens that morphed its shape to the BPM (beats per minute) of a song. The idea was really simple and would have been really fun to work on.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 1</h3>

<h6 id="the-problem-with-the-visualiser-however-was-that-it-would-have-required-a-lot-of-3d-animating-and-modelling-to-create-the-effect-that-i-required-as-well-as-this-i-was-unsure-of-the-scalability-of-the-project-from-a-development-point-of-view-once-the-hologram-was-moving-in-time-to-the-song-there-was-little-that-i-would-be-able-to-add-to-grow-the-project-further">The problem with the visualiser, however, was that it would have required a lot of 3D animating and modelling to create the effect that I required. As well as this, I was unsure of the scalability of the project from a development point of view. Once the hologram was moving in time to the song there was little that I would be able to add to grow the project further.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 2: Holo board Game</h3>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/holoboard.jpg" alt="HoloLens Board Game" /></p>

<h6 id="the-second-idea-that-i-had-was-to-develop-a-hololens-board-game-that-implemented-vuforias-image-tracking-to-combine-digital-and-traditional-gaming-this-would-give-the-effect-of-physical-cards-and-boards-coming-to-life-through-the-use-of-image-tracking">The second idea that I had was to develop a HoloLens board game that implemented Vuforia’s image tracking to combine digital and traditional gaming. This would give the effect of physical cards and boards coming to life through the use of image tracking.</h6>

<h6 id="the-system-for-the-board-game-would-be-very-simple-with-one-player-attacking-and-the-other-defending-the-defender-would-have-to-place-down-physical-barrier-over-the-board-such-as-walls-and-trees-to-try-and-stop-the-attacker-from-reaching-their-base-the-idea-would-have-been-simple-yet-effective">The system for the board game would be very simple with one player attacking and the other defending. The defender would have to place down physical barrier over the board such as walls and trees to try and stop the attacker from reaching their base. The idea would have been simple yet effective.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 2</h3>

<h6 id="the-problems-with-this-idea-was-working-out-how-to-trigger-events-between-the-attacker-and-the-defender-as-the-game-progressed-as-well-as-this-i-would-need-to-work-out-whether-these-events-would-be-completed-using-traditional-methods-such-as-dice-rolls-or-digital-ones-such-as-attack-buttons-and-animations-within-the-hololens">The problems with this idea was working out how to trigger events between the attacker and the defender as the game progressed. As well as this I would need to work out whether these events would be completed using traditional methods such as dice rolls or digital ones such as attack buttons and animations within the HoloLens.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 3: HoloLens Card Game</h3>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/holocard.jpeg" alt="HoloLens Card Game" /></p>

<h6 id="also-utilising-vuforias-hololens-integration-my-third-idea-was-to-create-a-card-game-that-projected-holograms-out-of-the-cards-much-like-in-the-animated-series-of-yu-gi-oh-once-the-cards-had-been-placed-the-hololens-would-handle-the-attack-and-defence-events-causing-the-holograms-to-animate-depending-on-the-attack-or-move-that-they-were-doing">Also utilising Vuforia’s HoloLens integration, my third idea was to create a card game that projected Holograms out of the cards much like in the animated series of ‘Yu-Gi-Oh!’. Once the cards had been placed, the HoloLens would handle the attack and defence events causing the holograms to animate depending on the attack or move that they were doing.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 3</h3>

<h6 id="the-main-issue-with-this-idea-once-again-was-the-heavy-aspect-on-design-to-create-a-playable-card-game-i-would-need-to-design-between-20-30-3d-models-with-various-animations-which-seemed-unfeasible">The main issue with this idea, once again, was the heavy aspect on design. To create a playable card game I would need to design between 20-30 3D models with various animations which seemed unfeasible.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">The Final Solution</h2>

<h6 id="having-received-feedback-from-my-class-and-after-further-discussion-with-my-lecturer-i-decided-to-pursue-my-second-idea-of-the-hololens-board-game-this-was-because-it-required-the-least-amount-of-design-work-to-create-a-barebones-prototype-of-the-project-this-meant-that-i-would-be-able-to-focus-directly-on-the-functionality-of-the-game-rather-than-messing-around-with-the-design-aspects-on-top-of-it">Having received feedback from my class and after further discussion with my lecturer, I decided to pursue my second idea of the HoloLens board game. This was because it required the least amount of design work to create a barebones prototype of the project. This meant that I would be able to focus directly on the functionality of the game rather than messing around with the design aspects on top of it.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">Changes to Idea 2</h2>

<h6 id="as-well-as-this-i-decided-to-make-some-amendments-to-the-board-game-firstly-the-game-would-be-single-player-and-the-user-would-place-objects-in-the-way-of-the-ai-attacker-to-stop-it-reaching-the-defenders-base-secondly-the-game-would-no-longer-require-event-triggers-or-event-cards-as-the-mechanics-of-the-game-had-become-far-more-simplified">As well as this, I decided to make some amendments to the board game. Firstly, the game would be single player and the user would place objects in the way of the ‘AI’ attacker to stop it reaching the defenders base. Secondly, the game would no longer require event triggers or event cards as the mechanics of the game had become far more simplified.</h6>

As seen in the picture above, I have chosen to track the ‘tower’ card with this Gameobject. After this, I simply added a tower Gameobject to the hierarchy and set it as the child of the Vuforia image Gameobject. This means that whenever Vuforia recognises the tower image, it will generate the hologram of the tower! It should be noted, however, that the hologram will spawn in relation to its distance from the image Gameobject in the Unity scene. Therefore, it is often good practice to ensure that the hologram is directly above the image target unless intended otherwise.</h6>

These can help to alter the pathfinding ability of your Navmesh agents e.g. whether they can climb a specific slope or jump over a specific wall. As I was working with flat surfaces, I didn’t really need to touch on these at all. As seen from the image, baking the navmesh defines the areas that the NavmeshAgent can move through. As the wall is above the maximum slope height, the Navmesh bakes around the wall defining that the agent will not be able to move through it.</h6>

For testing mine were defined by two cubes of different colours. Once this had been done, I added the ‘Nav Mesh Agent’ component to my ‘enemy’. This simply defines to the Navigation system that my ‘enemy’ Gameobject is an agent and that it can move across the Navmesh. Inside of the ‘Nav Mesh Agent’ component you are able to change various mechanics such as speed, angular speed and obstacle avoidance properties. Once again, as I was working with a very simple scene, I left these alone for the time being.</h6>

Once the NavMeshAgent is defined, I ran an if statement inside of the Update function (called once per frame) which checks to see whether or not a destination has been defined. If it has, the target vector is set to the destination and the NavMeshAgent sets its destination to the target. Here is the result of my code below:</h6>

In this instance, the action called was the SpawnAgent() function. Inside of this function, the attacker prefab is instantiated and transformed to the position of the spawner. Once this has completed, Unity locates destination inside of the GameObjects AttackerMove script, sets it as the goal and then moves towards it. Finally, SpawnAgent is invoked continuously at a random range between two variables. This creates a constant stream of enemies rather than waves, however, this was used to stress test the project on the HoloLens to ensure there was no latency.</h6>

However, from personal experience, I have never received notable latency when working on HoloLens applications without Vuforia. Therefore, I believed the problem to be entirely Vuforia related.

For some reason, the NavMesh surfaces code would entirely ignore the surfaces thatI was trying to target and simply create a mesh the size of the room that I was standing in. This meant that the enemies would not spawn as or move as the spawner was too far away from the NavMesh. I attempted to fix this bug, however, I was unable to come up with a solution for it.

When the Unity reaches one a duplicate wave name, it will automatically reset the wave number to 0. I am not completely sure why this happens, however, I decided to make sure that waves were saved with different names to avoid the bug.</h6>

As suggested before, I was initially using Unity’s windows speech library with the keyword recogniser to create speech recognition. The problem with this was that I was unable to get the recogniser to recognise more than one word or phrase. This meant that I would not be able to create multiple phrases such as wave starting and building towers.</h6>

For this reason, i decided to disable the HandDraggable script on the board after the first wave begins.</h6>

Therefore, I was unable to gather any beneficial feedback.</h6>

As well as this, it would have been better to use a different enemy movement system as the enemies can move through the towers that the user places down which makes the game look a little underdeveloped.</h6>

This would really help to flesh out the game and massively improve player enjoyment!n I think that I will continue to work on this project over the summer and potentially ship it the Microsoft Store.</h6>
