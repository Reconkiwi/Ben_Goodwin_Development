The portfolio had to contain the best of my work over the last three years which I would be able to take to employers to show off my skills. In the post I will discuss my design and branding choices as well as the reasons for adding the content that I have chosen.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Initial Branding</h3>

<h6 id="to-ensure-that-i-had-a-consistent-brand-throughout-my-website-and-professional-portfolio-i-initially-began-creating-colour-mockups-to-base-the-brand-off-of-i-knew-that-i-wanted-to-create-something-bright-and-eye-catching-to-reflect-my-imaginative-personality-this-is-also-reflected-in-my-work-where-i-have-chosen-to-take-an-alternative-development-route-to-my-peers-by-creating-games-and-mixed-virtual-and-augmented-reality-applications-i-began-creating-some-colour-palettes">To ensure that I had a consistent brand throughout my website and professional portfolio, I initially began creating colour mockups to base the brand off of. I knew that I wanted to create something bright and eye-catching to reflect my imaginative personality. This is also reflected in my work where I have chosen to take an alternative development route to my peers by creating games and mixed, virtual and augmented reality applications. I began creating some colour palettes:</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/firstpalette123.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="my-first-colour-palette-was-focussed-around-a-cobalt-blue-and-a-dark-grey-although-i-really-like-this-palette-i-didnt-really-feel-that-it-represented-me-as-a-person-with-the-colour-blue-often-being-associated-with-calmness-and-peace-i-did-however-really-like-the-dark-grey-colour-therefore-i-messed-around-with-other-colours-to-use-instead-of-blue">My first colour palette was focussed around a cobalt blue and a dark grey. Although I really like this palette, I didn’t really feel that it represented me as a person with the colour blue often being associated with calmness and peace. I did, however, really like the dark grey colour, therefore I messed around with other colours to use instead of blue:</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/greenbrooo.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="i-also-experimented-with-the-colour-green-however-also-felt-that-this-didnt-suit-my-image-either-i-did-notice-though-that-the-dark-grey-seemed-to-work-with-most-of-the-bright-colours-that-i-was-testing-it-with-therefore-i-kept-using-it-to-create-more-palettes">I also experimented with the colour green, however, also felt that this didn’t suit my image either. I did notice though, that the dark grey seemed to work with most of the bright colours that I was testing it with, therefore, I kept using it to create more palettes.</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/metrikcolours.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="i-eventually-came-up-with-my-final-colour-palette-that-used-a-hot-pink-as-one-of-the-primary-colours-from-my-research-the-colour-hot-pink-can-be-suggested-to-mean-youthfulness-energy-life-fun-and-passion-as-a-young-developer-trying-to-break-into-the-interactive-industry-i-feel-that-this-is-the-way-that-i-want-to-portray-myself-i-want-people-to-look-at-my-work-and-see-the-energy-and-passion-that-i-give-to-my-work">I eventually came up with my final colour palette that used a hot pink as one of the primary colours. From my research the colour ‘hot pink’ can be suggested to mean youthfulness, energy, life, fun and passion. As a young developer trying to break into the interactive industry, I feel that this is the way that I want to portray myself. I want people to look at my work and see the energy and passion that I give to my work.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">The Logo</h3>

<h6 id="once-the-colour-palette-was-setup-i-began-trying-to-come-up-with-an-exciting-and-different-approach-to-the-traditional-logo-as-i-wanted-to-work-in-3d-interactive-softwares-i-began-brainstorming-ideas-for-some-sort-of-interactive-logo-i-ended-up-working-with-threejs-which-is-a-javascript-framework-that-can-be-used-to-implement-3d-canvases-to-the-web-i-used-my-two-primary-colours-hot-pick-and-dark-grey-and-started-throwing-differently-shaped-3d-objects-together-i-ended-up-creating-three-eight-sided-shapes-that-rotate-in-different-directions-which-creates-the-image-of-one-moving-object-after-this-i-added-a-camera-rotation-and-particle-system-to-it-which-created-a-really-cool-interactive-hero-image-for-my-website-here-is-an-image-of-the-result">Once the colour palette was setup, I began trying to come up with an exciting and different approach to the traditional logo. As I wanted to work in 3D interactive softwares, I began brainstorming ideas for some sort of interactive logo. I ended up working with Three.JS which is a javascript framework that can be used to implement 3D canvases to the web. I used my two primary colours, hot pick and dark grey, and started throwing differently shaped 3D objects together. I ended up creating three eight sided shapes that rotate in different directions which creates the image of one moving object. After this I added a camera rotation and particle system to it which created a really cool interactive hero image for my website. Here is an image of the result:</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/heroimg.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="the-image-creates-an-almost-space-type-theme-to-the-sight-with-the-floating-particles-and-moving-objects-in-blank-space-to-me-this-highlights-that-my-brand-is-futuristic-and-innovative-as-the-object-itself-is-so-captivating-on-the-home-page-i-did-not-feel-that-i-required-a-set-logo-for-my-website-however-i-used-it-as-inspiration-for-the-logo-that-i-would-use-on-my-printed-portfolio-and-business-cards-my-final-logo-looked-like-this">The image creates an almost space type theme to the sight with the floating particles and moving objects in blank space. To me this highlights that my brand is futuristic and innovative. As the object itself is so captivating on the home page I did not feel that I required a set logo for my website, however, I used it as inspiration for the logo that I would use on my printed portfolio and business cards, My final logo looked like this:</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/logo.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="as-you-can-see-the-logo-is-a-static-representation-of-the-object-on-my-home-page">As you can see, the logo is a static representation of the object on my home page.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">The Font</h3>

<h6 id="i-chose-to-use-the-font-rajdhani-which-is-a-google-fonts-sans-serif-i-felt-that-this-font-was-quite-block-almost-geometric-and-had-a-modern-feel-to-it-without-being-too-clunky-which-was-the-vibe-that-i-was-trying-to-give-off">I chose to use the font ‘Rajdhani’ which is a Google Fonts sans-serif. I felt that this font was quite block, almost geometric, and had a modern feel to it without being too clunky which was the vibe that I was trying to give off.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Designing the Book</h3>

<h6 id="i-decided-to-keep-the-fonts-and-colours-for-both-my-printed-portfolio-and-pdf-to-ensure-that-the-brand-was-consistent-throughout-all-of-my-work-i-then-drew-up-some-wireframes-for-my-portfolio-so-that-i-could-work-out-how-to-best-present-my-projects-my-wireframes-looked-like-this">I decided to keep the fonts and colours for both my printed portfolio and pdf to ensure that the brand was consistent throughout all of my work. I then drew up some wireframes for my portfolio so that I could work out how to best present my projects. My wireframes looked like this:</h6>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/portfoliomockup.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="the-wireframe-of-the-project-was-designed-to-look-like-the-project-tiles-on-my-portfolio-site-a-direct-comparisson-can-be-seen-between-these-photos">The wireframe of the project was designed to look like the project tiles on my portfolio site a direct comparisson can be seen between these photos:</h6>

<h3 id="portfolio-site">Portfolio site</h3>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/webtilemockup.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h3 id="portfolio-pdf">Portfolio pdf</h3>

<p><img src="https://metrik.space/assets/pdfmockup.png" alt="developer mode" /></p>

<h6 id="as-you-can-see-the-mockups-follow-a-similar-format-to-ensure-that-my-pdf-and-printed-portfolio-matched-the-style-of-my-brand-this-can-also-be-seen-on-the-dark-grey-pages-of-my-professional-portfolio-which-use-a-white-and-pink-text-much-like-the-project-posts-on-my-website">As you can see, the mockups follow a similar format to ensure that my pdf and printed portfolio matched the style of my brand. This can also be seen on the dark grey pages of my professional portfolio which use a white and pink text much like the project posts on my website.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">The Content</h3>

<h6 id="i-decided-to-go-for-very-minimalistic-content-on-my-professional-portfolio-as-i-felt-that-i-wanted-it-to-showcase-the-best-of-my-work-rather-than-the-gritty-development-code-that-was-written-to-get-there-i-feel-that-this-may-be-a-different-approach-than-what-a-design-student-may-take-as-initial-sketching-and-wireframing-can-still-be-visually-pleasing-on-print-however-i-felt-that-most-people-reading-my-portfolio-would-not-be-interested-in-my-code-therefore-i-created-an-appendix-of-examples-of-my-code-for-each-project-at-the-back-of-my-book-so-that-it-would-not-distract-the-viewers-eye-from-my-final-projects-i-feel-that-this-was-the-right-decision-to-make-and-i-am-happy-with-the-outcome-of-it">I decided to go for very minimalistic content on my professional portfolio as I felt that I wanted it to showcase the best of my work rather than the gritty development code that was written to get there. I feel that this may be a different approach than what a design student may take as initial sketching and wireframing can still be visually pleasing on print. However, I felt that most people reading my portfolio would not be interested in my code. Therefore, I created an appendix of examples of my code for each project at the back of my book so that it would not distract the viewers eye from my final projects. I feel that this was the right decision to make and i am happy with the outcome of it.</h6>

<h3 id="the-projects">The Projects</h3>

<h6 id="deciding-which-projects-i-wanted-to-present-was-a-difficult-decision-for-me-as-i-wanted-to-ensure-that-the-best-of-my-work-was-being-shown-as-well-as-this-however-i-have-been-working-on-two-different-types-of-projects-over-the-last-three-years-interactive-technologies-and-web-technologies">Deciding which projects I wanted to present was a difficult decision for me as I wanted to ensure that the best of my work was being shown. As well as this, however, I have been working on two different types of projects over the last three years. Interactive technologies and web technologies.</h6>

<h6 id="the-projects-presented-i-feel-are-the-best-of-my-work-completed-over-three-years-ideally-i-would-have-finished-enough-projects-to-fill-my-book-with-entirely-interactive-technology-projects-however-as-i-did-not-i-also-included-the-best-of-my-web-development-projects-as-well">The projects presented, I feel, are the best of my work completed over three years. Ideally, I would have finished enough projects to fill my book with entirely interactive technology projects. However, as I did not, I also included the best of my web development projects as well.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Printing</h3>

<h6 id="i-decided-to-print-my-book-at-an-a5-paper-size-as-i-liked-the-idea-of-having-a-small-almost-pocket-sized-book-to-hand-to-potential-employers-also-as-my-book-was-only-32-pages-long-i-felt-that-any-larger-size-would-have-made-the-book-far-too-thin-as-well-as-this-i-opted-for-a-landscape-book-rather-than-portrait-as-i-felt-that-i-would-be-able-to-use-the-space-more-efficiently">I decided to print my book at an A5 paper size as I liked the idea of having a small, almost pocket sized book to hand to potential employers. Also, as my book was only 32 pages long, I felt that any larger size would have made the book far too thin. As well as this, I opted for a landscape book rather than portrait as I felt that I would be able to use the space more efficiently.</h6>

<h6 id="i-chose-to-print-with-a-glossy-silk-paper-as-my-research-suggested-that-glossy-paper-would-bring-out-the-pink-better-on-my-book-i-also-opted-for-a-slightly-thicker-cover-and-back-to-my-book-as-i-felt-that-it-gave-it-a-more-professional-finish">I chose to print with a glossy silk paper as my research suggested that glossy paper would bring out the pink better on my book. I also opted for a slightly thicker cover and back to my book as I felt that it gave it a more professional finish.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Online Interactivity</h3>

<h6 id="i-decided-to-add-buttons-to-my-online-portfolio-pdf-to-add-another-level-of-interactivity-to-it-the-buttons-simply-move-the-pages-backwards-and-forwards">I decided to add buttons to my online portfolio pdf to add another level of interactivity to it. The buttons simply move the pages backwards and forwards.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Final Conclusions</h3>

<h6 id="overall-i-was-really-pleased-with-the-final-outcomes-of-my-online-and-printed-professional-portfolio-as-i-am-usually-so-focussed-on-developing-from-other-peoples-designs-it-was-really-enjoyable-to-build-my-brand-from-the-ground-up-i-am-really-pleased-with-how-my-brand-has-grown-and-i-feel-that-employers-will-like-how-i-have-chosen-to-present-myself-as-well-as-this-my-printed-portfolio-will-always-remind-me-of-everything-that-i-have-accomplished-since-i-began-this-course-three-years-ago-and-is-something-to-be-proud-of">Overall, I was really pleased with the final outcomes of my online and printed professional portfolio. As I am usually so focussed on developing from other peoples designs, it was really enjoyable to build my brand from the ground up. I am really pleased with how my brand has grown and I feel that employers will like how I have chosen to present myself. As well as this my printed portfolio will always remind me of everything that I have accomplished since I began this course three years ago and is something to be proud of.</h6>
