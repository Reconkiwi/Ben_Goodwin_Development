  <p>The LUFC News project was a rebrand of Alex Matthews’ fan made community social media group and website. I had a direct role in re-developing Alex’s website by creating a new Wordpress theme for him from scratch which included a login system and live chat room.</p>

<h3 id="the-brief">The Brief</h3>
<p>During this semester we were required to organise or create our own briefs to complete over a 12 week period. As my development projects for my work placement had not begun yet, I decided to source an alternative project to work on for the rest of the semester rather than waiting for my work placement project to get up and running.</p>

<p>Alex Matthews, a client that I had worked with in my previous year of study (developing a prototype for his fan based Leeds Football news app), was looking to rebrand his community and identity starting with his social media platforms and eventually moving up to his website lufcnews.co.uk.</p>

<p>I was contacted after the rebrand of the company in the hope that I would build the site based on Alex’s LUFC News WordPress theme. Here is how the site looked before development started:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/oldlufchome.png" alt="The Old LUFC News Homepage" /></p>

<p>Alex had said to me that the website was no longer gaining consistent traffic and that the design had become outdated as he did not have the time or necessarily the skills to keep updating the templates.</p>

<p>It was clear that Alex’s website had become a little dated, so it was important for me to gain an understanding of precisely what he required from the sites redevelopment.</p>

<h2 id="alexs-specifications">Alex’s Specifications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Based on the original WordPress theme</li>
  <li>Consistent design</li>
  <li>LUFC News branding</li>
  <li>Look and feel eye-catching</li>
  <li>Simple to use</li>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>User chat systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as this Alex had a designer on my course draw up some designs for the site. These were as follows:</p>

<iframe src="/Ben_Goodwin_Development/assets/images.pdf"></iframe>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Alex Matthews (Owner)</li>
  <li>Ben Goodwin (Developer)</li>
  <li>Matt Hampsey (Designer)</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to minimal funding, our team for the rebrand was fairly small consisting of myself, Alex and Matt. This meant that I would be the only developer, and as the designs for the new site had been completed, it was up to me to work on development solely. Alex did also suggest that I could slightly alter the designs if I felt the need to do so. This was extremely beneficial to me as I personally like to have some input on the front-end design of development.</p>

<h2 id="initial-problems-and-solutions">Initial Problems and Solutions</h2>
<p>There were two main initial problems before development. Firstly, I had never developed using WordPress before, therefore, I had a fairly steep learning curve to take into account so that I could manage my time accordingly and I would need to read a few tutorials or speak to a WordPress specialist on my course as well to ensure I fully understood the WordPress theme development. Secondly, having looked through the code of Alex’s original theme I felt that it wouldn’t be possible to rebuild the site based off of his theme. This meant that I needed to discuss building a new theme from scratch with Alex as well as needing to find the quickest possible solution to building a WordPress theme from scratch. For this I needed to come up with a series of ideas:</p>

<h2 id="idea-1---building-pages-and-directories-from-scratch">Idea 1 - Building Pages and Directories from Scratch</h2>

<p>Initially I had considered creating the pages, configurations and directories from scratch. This would have meant that I would have a better understanding of WordPress’ systems and setup. As well as this it would mean that all of the code on the theme would be mine which would help with development further down the line as everything would be setup in the same format.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-1">Problems With Idea 1</h2>
<p>The main issue that i faced with this idea was the time that it would take me to get a blank WordPress theme up and running. Alex was hoping to see progress within the first two weeks of development which meant that I didn’t have a large window to get some of the pages completed.</p>

<h2 id="idea-2---a-course-mates-blank-template">Idea 2 - A Course Mates Blank Template</h2>

<p>The second idea was to build the site using a course mates blank WordPress theme. The benefits to this being that the blank template was being used commercially already, therefore, I was aware of the templates potential as I could see how it had been implemented into many sites.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-2">Problems With Idea 2</h2>
<p>The downside to this idea was that the blank template needed to be reformatted to ensure that it was not breaching any of the themes licensing agreements. This would have taken quite a lot of time and would have potentially caused more problems rather than solve any.</p>

<h2 id="idea-3---bones-theme">Idea 3 - Bones Theme</h2>

<p><img src="/home/assets/bones.jpg" alt="Bones Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<p>The third idea was to look into using the Bones WordPress theme. Bones is a HTML5, mobile first, blank theme used for rapid development. Bones also came with a free license meaning that I could use it for Alex’s site free of charge</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-3">Problems With Idea 3</h2>
<p>My biggest problem with Bones was that I couldn’t get on  with the documentation. This was a really large issue for me considering my lack of knowledge in Wordpress development.</p>

<h2 id="idea-4---underscores-theme">Idea 4 - Underscores theme</h2>
<p><img src="/Ben_Goodwin_Development/assets/underscores.png" alt="Underscores Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<p>Having looked into various solutions to my problem, and still being unsatisfied with my options, a masters student suggested Underscores to me. Underscores is a little like Bones, however, it aims to use minimal CSS which allows for developers to tear the base theme apart and completely rebuild it from the ground up. As well as this Underscores comes with a ready to go translation package and custom 404 pages to help get developers started.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-solution">The Final Solution</h2>
<p>I ended up opting for Underscores rather than any of the other options, this was mainly due to the large amounts of documentation and tutorials based around the theme. I felt that this would be really beneficial to me as I could use these to increase my development efficiency.</p>

<p>Once I had decided on my plan of action for the WordPress theme development. I decided to breakdown the project into the main tasks I needed to complete. These are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="the-breakdown">The Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Base Wordpress Theme</li>
  <li>Displaying Client Created Posts</li>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>User Chat System</li>
  <li>Fully Customisable Pages</li>
</ul>

<p>Having taken a look at the breakdown of the project, it was clear that I would need to somehow setup the Wordpress theme with editable text sections for Alex so that he could fully customise the content of the site. As well as this it was clear to me that both the user login systems and the chat system would be the last jobs on the list, even though they would most likely be the hardest to setup. This was because Alex wanted to see weekly updates on the progress of the website and I wanted him to feel satisfied after each weekly meeting.</p>

<p>Having scheduled these tasks accordingly I organised a preliminary meeting with Alex to discuss my plans and ensure that he was happy for me to crack on with development.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-1">Meeting 1</h2>

<p>During our first meeting, I pitched my proposed plan for the websites development. Alex seemed pleased with my scheduling tactics, however, he wanted me to grasp the importance of our audience within the website. Therefore, I decided to do some research into the main groups of people that we were trying to target with the rebrand. My research is as follows:</p>

<h2 id="target-audiences">Target Audiences</h2>
<h3 id="lufc-news-social-media-followers">LUFC News Social Media Followers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook Followers: 4,213</li>
  <li>Twitter Followers: 45</li>
  <li>Instagram Followers: 154</li>
  <li>Youtube Subscribers: 17</li>
</ul>

<p>The LUFC News social media platforms had a very mixed follower count. However, since the rebrand of the social media platforms, followers had been on the rise. It was important that the site helped to retain this community by creating a platform for followers to discuss their thoughts on the club and entice more people to get involved with the discussions.</p>

<h3 id="leeds-united-fans">Leeds United Fans</h3>

<p>For a team that hasn’t been a part of the Premiership since 2004, Leeds United have been regarded by Sky Sports (2019) as the 12th largest club in England (regarding their 50-year average league position) with an average home attendance of 25,123 this season (20th in England). With numbers like these and Leeds United on the rise towards promotion from the championship, there is a lot of room for Alex to grow LUFC News into a much larger community.</p>

<p>As well as this Leeds fans have become frustrated with the lack of coverage their team receives. Therefore, with the right rebrand Alex could pull fans away from Sky and towards LUFC News. The important thing to consider with the rebuild of the website was clearly the user experience. As well as this it was important that the site reflected the Leeds United brand with its design and content.</p>

<h3 id="andrea-radrizzani">Andrea Radrizzani</h3>

<p>Our final target was Andrea, the owner of Leeds United. It was important that he could see that LUFC News was a professional organisation that created its community purely for the fans. Andrea would be the final step to pushing LUFC News from a small organisation to a worldwide community, therefore, it was imperative that he was impressed by what we had created.</p>

<h2 id="technical-considerations">Technical Considerations</h2>

<p>Another important thing to consider before development was the technical side of the project. Luckily for myself, Alex was already set up with a server provider and domain name. This meant that I did not require much to get started with the project, other than my own laptop.</p>

<p>It had been suggested to me that I may need to suggest to Alex that he invested in ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for my project. However, I was unclear on what these were used for before development started. As well as this it was clear to me that I may have to ask Alex to put money toward API and WordPress plugin access.</p>

<h2 id="personal-considerations">Personal Considerations</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider in regards to my own development was the fact that I had never worked with a WordPress site before. This meant that I would need to focus on learning exactly how the content management system worked. This was something that I needed to consider when organising my time and workload each week.</p>

<p>As well as this I needed to ensure that I gave myself enough time to work on my other projects such as the LUFC News app prototype (see LUFC News App blog).</p>

<h2 id="organisation-and-timeline">Organisation and Timeline</h2>
<p>To best organise my time I broke the project down into development stages so that I could better allocate time for each area of development</p>

<h2 id="development-stages">Development Stages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: Discuss the development process, make changes to my plan if necessary.</li>
  <li>Stage 2: Develop a clear strategy for building the site.</li>
  <li>Stage 3: Begin development of the base WordPress theme.</li>
  <li>Stage 4: User test base theme and amend problems.</li>
  <li>Stage 5: Begin development on login systems.</li>
  <li>Stage 6: Setup chat system.</li>
  <li>Stage 7: Bug test and amend.</li>
  <li>Stage 7: Final meeting with Alex</li>
  <li>Stage 8: Go live!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>To keep on track of our tasks, Alex wanted us to use a platform where we could note our weekly schedules for the project. We opted to use TeamWeek to do this:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/teamweek.png" alt="TeamWeek" /></p>

<p>As well as this we created a WhatsApp group so that I could contact Alex when I needed any information or feedback from him regarding the website. This system was good during development as it meant that we could keep on track of each others schedules easily and, therefore, increase efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="personal-goals">Personal Goals</h2>
<p>As this was my final year of study, I wanted to ensure that I pushed myself to learn as many new skills as possible. Although WordPress is built using PHP, HTML5 and CSS, I felt that learning WordPress as a CMS would be beneficial to me as VentureBeat (2018) suggest WordPress powers 30% of the web so it is likely that I would reuse the skills that i had learnt during development. To ensure I’d learn the most from this project, I set myself some personal goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn WordPress</li>
  <li>Strengthen PHP Skills</li>
  <li>Learn to Create Secure logins</li>
  <li>Learn About Advanced Custom fields</li>
  <li>Create a Commercial Site that will Last</li>
</ul>

<p>I felt that these were a good set of goals to have and if I was able to complete them then it would improve my skills as a developer.</p>

<h2 id="personal-gannt-chart">Personal Gannt Chart</h2>
<p>As well as the TeamWeek and WhatsApp system that we were using, I also created a personal Gantt chart of my own deadlines:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/lufc_site_gantt.png" alt="Gantt Chart" /></p>

<h2 id="development-tools">Development Tools</h2>
<p>To organise myself efficiently, I also made a list of the development tools that I would need to use:</p>

<h3 id="mamp">MAMP</h3>

<p>MAMP is a free local environment server that is often used when working with languages such as PHP. As WordPress sites are built using PHP, MAMP was the perfect tool for the development of Alex’s theme.</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/mamp.jpg" alt="Gantt Chart" /></p>

<h3 id="mysql">MySQL</h3>

<p>WordPress also requires databases to store the posts, users and comments. Therefore, MySQL, an open source relational database system was a good option for the development of this. As well as this MAMP has phpMyAdmin, an administration tool for MySQL, integrated within it, therefore, it would be efficient to use this tool.</p>

<h3 id="html-css-and-js">HTML, CSS AND JS</h3>

<p>Like most other websites, HTML, CSS and JS are imperative to web development. Therefore, I would be using these for development as well.</p>

<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
<p>PHP is a server-side coding language for web development and is directly used during WordPress theme development. It was clear that I would need to use this during my development.</p>

<h2 id="initial-development">Initial Development</h2>
<p>Before I begin discussing the initial development of the the LUFC News theme, I will outline the WordPress plugins that I have used to help with my development and an explanation as to why I have used them.</p>

<h3 id="wordpress-plugins">WordPress Plugins</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Custom fields</li>
</ul>

<p>Likely to be the most important plugin that I used during my development. Advanced Custom Fields are used to help improve the efficiency of creating user input fields for WordPress themes. This plugin was recommended to me by a developer on my course as he had said to me that the studio he had been working in had been using this plugin for all of their commercial products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact Form 7</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple but effective form plugin, however, it comes setup with an anti-spam software to help protect the client from spam mail.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gmail SMTP</li>
</ul>

<p>The WordPress emailing system fails when running on local servers, therefore, Gmail SMTP was used to help test the contact forms and user logins of the site.</p>

<ul>
  <li>iFlyChat</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple chat plugin with chatrooms and embed system for multiple platforms. As well as this iFlyChat comes with its own dashboard where the administrator of the site can monitor what is being discussed in the chat with the ability to set banned words as well as kick, ban or ban the IP of any user they wish.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Instagram feed</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple instagram plugin to show the clients feed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Menu Image</li>
</ul>

<p>A plugin to add images or logos to the WordPress menus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Soccer Info</li>
</ul>

<p>A plugin to display the league tables of specific football tournaments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>WP Rest API</li>
</ul>

<p>JSON based rest API for Wordpress, used for the LUFC App (see LUFC App blog post for more details).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ultimate Responsive Image Slider</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple image Slider used to display image galleries for all platforms.</p>

<ul>
  <li>JWT Authentication for WP-API</li>
</ul>

<p>Extends the WP Rest API to allow for JSON Authentication (also used for the LUFC App).</p>

<h3 id="initialising-the-theme">Initialising the Theme</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Set up Underscores blank theme.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Set up WordPress development environment</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/home/assets/underscores_generate.png" alt="Underscores Generator" /></p>

<p>Step 1: Setting up the Underscores blank WordPress theme proved fairly easy, the site comes with plenty of simple instructions. Having done this, the next step was to simply paste the blank theme into the themes folder in the WordPress directory wp-content/themes.</p>

<p>Step 2: Having downloaded and installed the WordPress files, it was time to link the WordPress files to the localhost database. To do this, I placed the WordPress directory into MAMP’s htdocs folder then using phpMyAdmin created a database in MySQL. The last step was to access the wp-config.php file and ammend the database name, user and password:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/wp-database.png" alt="wp-db" /></p>

<p>Once this had been completed I was able to access the theme via the appearance section of the WordPress backend:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/changetheme.png" alt="wp-theme-activation" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 3: Breaking Down the Page Setups</li>
</ul>

<p>From the research that I had completed regarding the development of Wordpress themes, I was able to see that the pages were broken down into three specific sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Header.php</li>
  <li>‘PageTemplate’.php</li>
  <li>Footer.php</li>
</ul>

<p>Header.php: The header file usually contains some of the stylesheets and the navigation for the site. It is placed in a separate file so that you are able to quickly call it in every page with a simple php script:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/getheader.png" alt="wp-getheader" /></p>

<p>My version of the Header.php ended up looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/headerphp.png" alt="header-php" /></p>

<p>The code for the header was fairly simple to write. As seen in the code I simply created an array that posted the primary-menu (menu-1) into the page and then styled it afterwards to display across a bar at the top of the page. As well as this I used a simple JQuery function to hide the menu when on mobile and display a simple fontawesome hamburger menu. This was an extremely simple function that I found within the underscores generated blank theme, however, I plan on changing this to something slightly animated and more stylised for the sites launch on the 3rd January.</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/finalheaderwp.png" alt="header-php" /></p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/finalmobileheaderwp.png" alt="header-php" /></p>

<p>Above are the final outcomes of the header. After some discussion and feedback with Alex, it was made clear that he wanted to include the logo instead of the home button text. To do this I used the Menu Image plugin and gave his logo a white circle border so that he wouldn’t lose the blue in his logo. As well as this the text originally sat indented further with smaller text, however, after my discussion with Alex he agreed to let me increase the size of the text and push it to the left.</p>

<p>Footer.php: Much like the header.php file, the footer.php is used to reduce the bulky repetition of code within each page and is called in a php script much like the header with <?php get_footer ?>. The final code for my footer looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/footerphp.png" alt="footer-php" /></p>

<p>Much like the header, I created an array of the secondary-menu (menu-2) which I then styled using display: flex; to create a similar sort of layout to the header. As well as this Alex required that his social media pages were available across the footer. Therefore, I used some font awesome icons and Advanced Custom Fields to create these which would allow Alex to edit the links at any time via the Wordpress backend.</p>

<p>As seen in the screenshot of the footer.php, the custom field is set up by setting an editable field and then echoing that field onto the page.</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/website_options.png" alt="website_options" /></p>

<p>One issue that I found with this, however, was that I would have to recreate these fields on every ACF page for them to display in the footer. Luckily, a MA student was able to offer me some advice on how to store ACF fields globally. To do this I needed to add a function to the functions.php file:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/websiteoptionsfunctions.png" alt="websiteoptionsfunctions" /></p>

<p>This function created an options page that allowed me to post custom fields globally. After that had been completed, I simply had to add ‘option’ to the php echo query.</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/finalfooterwp.png" alt="final-footer" /></p>

<p>Above is the final result of the footer, it ended up with a fairly simple design, however, it works nicely with the rest of the site.</p>

<p>‘PageTemplate’.php: This php document is the main template defined for each specific page. It is also the page that compiles together both the header and the footer.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-creating-the-homepage">Step 4: Creating the Homepage</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Recent Post Grid</li>
</ul>

<p>To create the recent post grid I wrote a query to create an array of all of the posts and then display the post thumbnail as the background image with he title overlaying. Below is the final result of the query:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/newpostgrid.png" alt="new-post-query" /></p>

<p>As seen in the query, whilst the site has posts it displays them in bootstrap col’s. After it has collected the posts, it simply echos that thumbnail and post title to the page. One of the problems that I faced developing this was that the posts were not limited. This meant that if left long enough the posts would take over a massive amount of the page. After doing a little research on the Stack Overflow forums, I was able to find an answer. In the array you can simply set the posts_per_page which will help to limit this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The App Features Repeater</li>
</ul>

<p>To allow for maximum customisation of the site, I decided to look into using advanced custom fields to create grids of features for the app on the homepage. As ACF is a paid plugin it contains a lot of extra features that do not exist in regular custom fields. One of these is the repeater.</p>

<p>The repeater is used so that the client can keep adding panels of the same layouts with different information. As I knew that Alex’s site would require plenty of these repeated layouts, I felt that it would be beneficial to me to learn how the ACF repeater worked.</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/featuresrepeater.png" alt="acf-repeater" /></p>

<p>As seen in the image above, the repeater is built by creating sub-fields. As you can see in the features repeater, I decided to use an image, text and text area. The outcome in the WordPress backend looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/featuresrepeaterbackend.png" alt="features-repeater-backend" /></p>

<p>Having done this, ACF pushes out php code for each of its fields. The resulting code looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/featuresrepeatercode.png" alt="features-repeater-backend" /></p>

<p>The main issue that I had with this, however, was that my subscription of ACF would not fetch some of the code for the more complex fields such as repeaters. This meant that I had to do some research to find some examples of repeater code.</p>

<p>Here is the final screen shot of the homepage:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/homepage.png" alt="features-repeater-backend" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>My Opinions and Amendments</li>
</ul>

<p>After the initial development of the site, I was quite happy with the final result. However, after some discussions with some of the design students on my course I amended some of the font sizing and padding across the page. As well as this I ensure that the mobile version of the page was completely responsive so that I had a base to work from given the lack of mobile wireframes I was given.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-other-pages-and-amendments">Step 5: Other Pages and Amendments</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The News Page</li>
</ul>

<p>The news page followed a very similar format to the recent news grid discussed in the homepage section, however, I removed the cap on the amount of posts being displayed so that the user can see every post written on the page.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The About Page</li>
</ul>

<p>The about page was reformatted and redesigned after me and Alex discussed my problems with the original wireframe.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Contact Page and App Page</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these pages included a contact form 7 as well as a google map iframe and were redesigned to differ from the original wireframes to be more mobile friendly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Leeds UFC+ Page</li>

<p>The Leeds UFC+ page took advantage of repeaters and sports API plugins to give an in depth and customisable analysis of the Leeds united Football Team.</p>

  <li>The Privacy, Terms and Community Guidelines Pages</li>
</ul>

<p>These pages were given a simple Wizzywig editor as they were very simple pages with barely formatted text.</p>

<h3 id="the-login-system">The Login System</h3>
<p>Creating the login systems for the site was one of the more difficult tasks to complete. Luckily, I was able to follow an interesting <a href="https://millionclues.com/tutorials/custom-wordpress-register-login-page/">tutorial</a> into creating custom login and register systems for users.</p>

<p>As the login system is built off of the WordPress logins, the code, if anything, is more of a re-directory system. Therefore, the most important code to refer to is within the functions.php file:</p>

<p><img src="/home/assets/functionslogin.png" alt="login-function" /></p>

<p>This code creates redirect passages for the login systems. as well as this it also calls the functions for failed login attempts as well as verifying usernames and passwords.</p>

<h3 id="the-chat-system">The Chat System</h3>

<p>Although, I planned to build my own chat system at first, after some consideration, it seemed more beneficial to use a plugin that would be farm more secure. Another reason for this is that as a commercial site, LUFC News would require a secure chat system that could be externally monitored with a host of features such as banning and kicking users. This is something I felt that I did not have to time to do in 12 weeks along with the LUFC app prototype.</p>

<p>I managed to source a plugin called iFlyChat, a simple chat plugin for WordPress. The good thing about using this plugin was that you could export the chat to multiple platforms aside from WordPress so i would potentially be able to use it for the app as well.</p>

<h2 id="final-changes-and-feedback">Final Changes and feedback</h2>

<p>During development I asked for a lot of feedback so that I could make changes to the site as I developed. Most of the issues brought up were usually slight padding changes or general CSS amendments. As well as this I scheduled weekly meetings with Alex so that he could make his own decisions based on how he wanted specific parts of pages to be changed. This was extremely beneficial as it meant that I could ensure that he was always happy with the product.</p>

<h2 id="final-product">Final Product</h2>

<p>I am pleased with the final product that I have created for Alex. Having shown him the development on the way in weekly intervals, I feel that he was happy with the progress that we made. As well as this I think that I have completed the goals that i had set myself for this project and have become a better developer because of it.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-steps">The Next Steps</h2>

<p>The next step of this project is to make a few additional changes to the site such as the mobile navigation as well as add recaptcha to logins to avoid spam accounts and emails. after this, myself and Alex aim to have the site live by the 3rd of January 2019.</p>

<p>You can find the site at <a href="https://lufcnews.co.uk/">lufcnews.co.uk</a></p>

<p>See the code on <a href="https://github.com/Reconkiwi/Football-Wordpress-Theme">GitHub</a></p>

<h2 id="the-hand-over-document">The Hand Over Document</h2>

<p>To ensure Alex was happy with the final product, myself and Matt created him an easy to read handover document outlining the branding guidelines and technical systems used for development. This is how it looked:</p>
