<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 1: Wrapping a Styled HTML Site</h3>

<h6 id="my-first-idea-was-to-create-the-app-as-if-i-were-developing-a-regular-html-website-using-a-one-page-javascript-framework-and-then-subsequently-phone-wrapping-it-by-placing-the-whole-file-inside-a-blank-ionic-src-folder-and-building-it-from-there-this-is-something-that-i-had-done-previously-for-alex-when-developing-the-first-prototype-for-his-app">My first idea was to create the app as if I were developing a regular HTML website using a ‘one page’ Javascript framework and then subsequently phone wrapping it by placing the whole file inside a blank Ionic src folder and building it from there. This is something that i had done previously for Alex when developing the first prototype for his app.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 1</h3>

<h6 id="my-main-issue-with-this-idea-was-that-i-felt-slightly-unprofessional-and-lazy-compiling-his-app-in-this-way-this-process-works-extremely-well-for-very-basic-prototypes-however-as-alex-had-already-received-one-of-these-i-wanted-to-ensure-that-his-new-prototype-was-to-a-higher-standard-than-the-previous">My main issue with this idea was that I felt slightly unprofessional and lazy compiling his app in this way. This process works extremely well for very basic prototypes, however, as Alex had already received one of these, I wanted to ensure that his new prototype was to a higher standard than the previous.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 2: Building directly to Ionic using Angular</h3>

<h6 id="another-idea-that-i-had-was-to-build-the-app-up-from-a-blank-ionic-app-ionics-most-recent-update-included-angular-integration-therefore-it-would-be-a-good-chance-to-learn-a-new-framework-and-coding-language-as-well-as-this-ionic-is-a-popular-framework-for-web-app-development-so-it-was-likely-that-there-would-be-plenty-of-documentation-to-help-me-stay-on-track">Another idea that I had was to build the app up from a blank Ionic app. Ionic’s most recent update included Angular integration, therefore, it would be a good chance to learn a new framework and coding language. As well as this Ionic is a popular framework for web app development, so it was likely that there would be plenty of documentation to help me stay on track.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 2</h3>

<h6 id="the-issues-facing-this-development-were-that-as-i-had-suggested-earlier-i-had-never-built-an-application-using-ionic-nor-had-i-ever-used-angular-as-a-coding-language-this-would-mean-that-it-would-likely-take-me-longer-to-learn-how-to-use-the-language-and-how-the-framework-works">The issues facing this development were that, as I had suggested earlier, I had never built an application using Ionic nor had I ever used Angular as a coding language. This would mean that it would likely take me longer to learn how to use the language and how the framework works.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Idea 3: Xcode and Android Studio</h3>

<h6 id="the-final-option-was-to-develop-the-app-using-xcode-and-android-studio-this-would-probably-be-the-most-professional-development-outcome-as-many-companies-will-develop-applications-directly-for-each-platform-ios-and-android-whereas-frameworks-such-as-ionic-are-simple-and-developed-for-both-platforms-simultaneously">The final option was to develop the app using Xcode and Android Studio. This would probably be the most professional development outcome as many companies will develop applications directly for each platform IOS and Android whereas frameworks such as Ionic are simple and developed for both platforms simultaneously.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Problems with Idea 3</h3>

<h6 id="unfortunately-the-largest-problem-faced-with-this-idea-were-the-time-constraints-i-did-not-have-enough-time-to-develop-an-app-twice-for-each-platform-as-well-as-this-i-have-never-used-these-technologies-before-and-the-amount-of-work-that-i-would-need-to-put-in-to-get-the-prototype-working-was-not-feasible">Unfortunately the largest problem faced with this idea were the time constraints. I did not have enough time to develop an app twice for each platform. As well as this I have never used these technologies before and the amount of work that I would need to put in to get the prototype working was not feasible.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">The Final Solution</h2>

<h6 id="i-eventually-decided-to-pitch-the-2nd-idea-that-i-had-to-alex-where-i-would-build-an-application-directly-into-the-ionic-framework-i-felt-that-this-would-be-a-good-chance-for-me-to-learn-some-new-skills-and-push-my-development-capabilities-further">I eventually decided to pitch the 2nd idea that I had to Alex where I would build an application directly into the Ionic framework. I felt that this would be a good chance for me to learn some new skills and push my development capabilities further.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">The First Meeting with Alex</h2>

<h6 id="having-decided-on-my-preferred-idea-i-pitched-this-to-alex-during-our-first-meeting-alex-seemed-happy-with-my-decision-moving-forwards-and-ensured-that-i-understood-exactly-what-he-wanted-the-app-to-do-having-gotten-the-go-ahead-from-alex-i-decided-to-breakdown-the-project-into-the-main-tasks-that-i-needed-to-complete">Having decided on my preferred idea, I pitched this to Alex during our first meeting. Alex seemed happy with my decision moving forwards and ensured that I understood exactly what he wanted the app to do. Having gotten the go ahead from Alex I decided to breakdown the project into the main tasks that I needed to complete.</h6>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">The Breakdown</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Setup Wordpress API’S</li>
  <li>Display WordPress posts to app</li>
  <li>Create login menus</li>
  <li>Setup JSON Authentication</li>
  <li>Design the leftover pages</li>

<h2 class="single-post-sub-head">Organisation and Timeline</h2>

<h6 id="to-organise-my-time-precisely-i-created-a-set-of-development-stages-that-i-could-work-towards-each-week-as-the-site-needed-to-be-completed-before-i-began-work-on-the-app-prototype-my-time-was-limited-to-around-4-weeks">To organise my time precisely I created a set of development stages that I could work towards each week. As the site needed to be completed before I began work on the app prototype, my time was limited to around 4 weeks.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Development Stages</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: Setup WordPress API’s</li>
  <li>Stage 2: Strategise for efficient app development</li>
  <li>Stage 3: Begin developing the blank Ionic template</li>

This means once the app is created it can be built for any mobile device. This allows for quick creating of applications as well as fast deployment. Ionic 4 now heavily uses Angular for development.</h6>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Angular</h3>

<h3 class="single-post-sub-head">Rest API's</h3>

<h6 id="rest-apis-take-advantage-http-when-being-used-for-web-therefore-developers-are-not-required-to-download-libraries-or-additional-software-to-use-them">Rest API’s take advantage HTTP when being used for web, therefore, developers are not required to download libraries or additional software to use them.</h6>

As I was limited to four weeks I felt that it would be more beneficial to create the navigation like this rather than spend more of my time creating my own navigation system.</h6>

This is why there is no navigation menu available, to ensure that the user can’t access other pages without defining in they are a guest or have an account.</h6>

It keeps the login button available on the navigation menu which directs the user back to login again. Given more time I would have allocated some time to create a session system when if the user is logged in a logout button replaces the login button and by pressing it, it will end the session. As well as this the login system requires a recaptcha to avoid any unwanted spam.</h6>

  <li>The API Problem</li>

This meant that I was unable to setup any of the live fixtures, results and league tables on the app as I could not be granted access to the data. This was a bit of a shame but I still mapped out how I felt the pages should look so that Alex could have a good understanding of what he wanted for when he had available funding.</h6>

As iFlyChat has HTML integration, I believed that I would be able to call this embed into the index.html of the LUFC News app. Unfortunately, the embed is returning an error which I believe to be caused by the companies outdated code. i have contacted them about this but was unable to receive any information back in time for this submission. This was a massive disappointment as I feel that the chat system would have strengthened the final product much more.</h6>

As well as this Alex was extremely happy with the overall design and feel of the app. We have been in discussions regarding his feedback and he has decided that he will be investing in an API so that I can fully develop the app for a beta launch next month which is really exciting.</h6>
