	    <h2 class="single_post_title">The LUFC Site - Y3S1</h2>

<div class="container singe_post_cont">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
  <p>The LUFC News project was a rebrand of Alex Matthews’ fan made community/ social media group and website. I had a direct role in re-developing Alex’s website by creating a new Wordpress theme for him from scratch which included a login system and live chat room.</p>

<h3 id="the-brief">The Brief</h3>
<p>During this semester we were required to organise or create our own briefs to complete over a 12 week period. As my development projects for my work placement had not begun yet, I decided to source an alternative project to work on for the rest of the semester rather than waiting for my work placement project to get up and running.</p>

<p>Alex Matthews, a client that I had worked with in my previous year of study (developing a prototype for his fan based Leeds Football news app), was looking to rebrand his community and identity starting with his social media platforms and eventually moving up to his website lufcnews.co.uk.</p>

<p>I was contacted after the rebrand of the company in the hope that I would build the site based on Alex’s LUFC News WordPress theme. Here is how the site looked before development started:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/oldlufchome.png" alt="The Old LUFC News Homepage" /></p>

<p>Alex had said to me that the website was no longer gaining consistent traffic and that the design had become outdated as he did not have the time or necessarily the skills to keep updating the templates.</p>

<p>It was clear that Alex’s website had become a little dated, so it was important for me to gain an understanding of precisely what he required from the sites redevelopment.</p>

<h2 id="alexs-specifications">Alex’s Specifications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Based on the original WordPress theme</li>
  <li>Consistent design</li>
  <li>LUFC News branding</li>
  <li>Look and feel eye-catching</li>
  <li>Simple to use</li>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>User chat systems</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as this Alex had a designer on my course draw up some designs for the site. These were as follows:</p>

<iframe src="/assets/images.pdf"></iframe>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Alex Matthews (Owner)</li>
  <li>Ben Goodwin (Developer)</li>
  <li>Matt Hampsey (Designer)</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to minimal funding, our team for the rebrand was fairly small consisting of myself, Alex and Matt. This meant that I would be the only developer, and as the designs for the new site had been completed, it was up to me to work on development solely. Alex did also suggest that I could slightly alter the designs if I felt the need to do so. This was extremely beneficial to me as I personally like to have some input on the front-end design of development.</p>

<h2 id="initial-problems-and-solutions">Initial Problems and Solutions</h2>
<p>There were two main initial problems before development. Firstly, I had never developed using WordPress before, therefore, I had a fairly steep learning curve to take into account so that I could manage my time accordingly and I would need to read a few tutorials or speak to a WordPress specialist on my course as well to ensure I fully understood the WordPress theme development. Secondly, having looked through the code of Alex’s original theme I felt that it wouldn’t be possible to rebuild the site based off of his theme. This meant that I needed to discuss building a new theme from scratch with Alex as well as needing to find the quickest possible solution to building a WordPress theme from scratch. For this I needed to come up with a series of ideas:</p>

<h2 id="idea-1---building-pages-and-directories-from-scratch">Idea 1 - Building Pages and Directories from Scratch</h2>

<p>Initially I had considered creating the pages, configurations and directories from scratch. This would have meant that I would have a better understanding of WordPress’ systems and setup. As well as this it would mean that all of the code on the theme would be mine which would help with development further down the line as everything would be setup in the same format.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-1">Problems With Idea 1</h2>
<p>The main issue that i faced with this idea was the time that it would take me to get a blank WordPress theme up and running. Alex was hoping to see progress within the first two weeks of development which meant that I didn’t have a large window to get some of the pages completed.</p>

<h2 id="idea-2---a-course-mates-blank-template">Idea 2 - A Course Mates Blank Template</h2>

<p>The second idea was to build the site using a course mates blank WordPress theme. The benefits to this being that the blank template was being used commercially already, therefore, I was aware of the templates potential as I could see how it had been implemented into many sites.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-2">Problems With Idea 2</h2>
<p>The downside to this idea was that the blank template needed to be reformatted to ensure that it was not breaching any of the themes licensing agreements. This would have taken quite a lot of time and would have potentially caused more problems rather than solve any.</p>

<h2 id="idea-3---bones-theme">Idea 3 - Bones Theme</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/bones.jpg" alt="Bones Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<p>The third idea was to look into using the Bones WordPress theme. Bones is a HTML5, mobile first, blank theme used for rapid development. Bones also came with a free license meaning that I could use it for Alex’s site free of charge</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-idea-3">Problems With Idea 3</h2>
<p>My biggest problem with Bones was that I couldn’t get on  with the documentation. This was a really large issue for me considering my lack of knowledge in Wordpress development.</p>

<h2 id="idea-4---underscores-theme">Idea 4 - Underscores theme</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/underscores.png" alt="Underscores Wordpress Theme" /></p>

<p>Having looked into various solutions to my problem, and still being unsatisfied with my options, a masters student suggested Underscores to me. Underscores is a little like Bones, however, it aims to use minimal CSS which allows for developers to tear the base theme apart and completely rebuild it from the ground up. As well as this Underscores comes with a ready to go translation package and custom 404 pages to help get developers started.</p>

<h2 id="the-final-solution">The Final Solution</h2>
<p>I ended up opting for Underscores rather than any of the other options, this was mainly due to the large amounts of documentation and tutorials based around the theme. I felt that this would be really beneficial to me as I could use these to increase my development efficiency.</p>

<p>Once I had decided on my plan of action for the WordPress theme development. I decided to breakdown the project into the main tasks I needed to complete. These are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="the-breakdown">The Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Base Wordpress Theme</li>
  <li>Displaying Client Created Posts</li>
  <li>User logins</li>
  <li>User Chat System</li>
  <li>Fully Customisable Pages</li>
</ul>

<p>Having taken a look at the breakdown of the project, it was clear that I would need to somehow setup the Wordpress theme with editable text sections for Alex so that he could fully customise the content of the site. As well as this it was clear to me that both the user login systems and the chat system would be the last jobs on the list, even though they would most likely be the hardest to setup. This was because Alex wanted to see weekly updates on the progress of the website and I wanted him to feel satisfied after each weekly meeting.</p>

<p>Having scheduled these tasks accordingly I organised a preliminary meeting with Alex to discuss my plans and ensure that he was happy for me to crack on with development.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-1">Meeting 1</h2>

<p>During our first meeting, I pitched my proposed plan for the websites development. Alex seemed pleased with my scheduling tactics, however, he wanted me to grasp the importance of our audience within the website. Therefore, I decided to do some research into the main groups of people that we were trying to target with the rebrand. My research is as follows:</p>

<h2 id="target-audiences">Target Audiences</h2>
<h3 id="lufc-news-social-media-followers">LUFC News Social Media Followers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook Followers: 4,213</li>
  <li>Twitter Followers: 45</li>
  <li>Instagram Followers: 154</li>
  <li>Youtube Subscribers: 17</li>
</ul>

<p>The LUFC News social media platforms had a very mixed follower count. However, since the rebrand of the social media platforms, followers had been on the rise. It was important that the site helped to retain this community by creating a platform for followers to discuss their thoughts on the club and entice more people to get involved with the discussions.</p>

<h3 id="leeds-united-fans">Leeds United Fans</h3>

<p>For a team that hasn’t been a part of the Premiership since 2004, Leeds United have been regarded by Sky Sports (2019) as the 12th largest club in England (regarding their 50-year average league position) with an average home attendance of 25,123 this season (20th in England). With numbers like these and Leeds United on the rise towards promotion from the championship, there is a lot of room for Alex to grow LUFC News into a much larger community.</p>

<p>As well as this Leeds fans have become frustrated with the lack of coverage their team receives. Therefore, with the right rebrand Alex could pull fans away from Sky and towards LUFC News. The important thing to consider with the rebuild of the website was clearly the user experience. As well as this it was important that the site reflected the Leeds United brand with its design and content.</p>

<h3 id="andrea-radrizzani">Andrea Radrizzani</h3>

<p>Our final target was Andrea, the owner of Leeds United. It was important that he could see that LUFC News was a professional organisation that created its community purely for the fans. Andrea would be the final step to pushing LUFC News from a small organisation to a worldwide community, therefore, it was imperative that he was impressed by what we had created.</p>

<h2 id="technical-considerations">Technical Considerations</h2>

<p>Another important thing to consider before development was the technical side of the project. Luckily for myself, Alex was already set up with a server provider and domain name. This meant that I did not require much to get started with the project, other than my own laptop.</p>

<p>It had been suggested to me that I may need to suggest to Alex that he invested in ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for my project. However, I was unclear on what these were used for before development started. As well as this it was clear to me that I may have to ask Alex to put money toward API and WordPress plugin access.</p>

<h2 id="personal-considerations">Personal Considerations</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider in regards to my own development was the fact that I had never worked with a WordPress site before. This meant that I would need to focus on learning exactly how the content management system worked. This was something that I needed to consider when organising my time and workload each week.</p>

<p>As well as this I needed to ensure that I gave myself enough time to work on my other projects such as the LUFC News app prototype (see LUFC News App blog).</p>

<h2 id="organisation-and-timeline">Organisation and Timeline</h2>
<p>To best organise my time I broke the project down into development stages so that I could better allocate time for each area of development</p>

<h2 id="development-stages">Development Stages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1: Discuss the development process, make changes to my plan if necessary.</li>
  <li>Stage 2: Develop a clear strategy for building the site.</li>
  <li>Stage 3: Begin development of the base WordPress theme.</li>
  <li>Stage 4: User test base theme and amend problems.</li>
  <li>Stage 5: Begin development on login systems.</li>
  <li>Stage 6: Setup chat system.</li>
  <li>Stage 7: Bug test and amend.</li>
  <li>Stage 7: Final meeting with Alex</li>
  <li>Stage 8: Go live!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>To keep on track of our tasks, Alex wanted us to use a platform where we could note our weekly schedules for the project. We opted to use TeamWeek to do this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/teamweek.png" alt="TeamWeek" /></p>

<p>As well as this we created a WhatsApp group so that I could contact Alex when I needed any information or feedback from him regarding the website. This system was good during development as it meant that we could keep on track of each others schedules easily and, therefore, increase efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="personal-goals">Personal Goals</h2>
<p>As this was my final year of study, I wanted to ensure that I pushed myself to learn as many new skills as possible. Although WordPress is built using PHP, HTML5 and CSS, I felt that learning WordPress as a CMS would be beneficial to me as VentureBeat (2018) suggest WordPress powers 30% of the web so it is likely that I would reuse the skills that i had learnt during development. To ensure I’d learn the most from this project, I set myself some personal goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn WordPress</li>
  <li>Strengthen PHP Skills</li>
  <li>Learn to Create Secure logins</li>
  <li>Learn About Advanced Custom fields</li>
  <li>Create a Commercial Site that will Last</li>
</ul>

<p>I felt that these were a good set of goals to have and if I was able to complete them then it would improve my skills as a developer.</p>

<h2 id="personal-gannt-chart">Personal Gannt Chart</h2>
<p>As well as the TeamWeek and WhatsApp system that we were using, I also created a personal Gantt chart of my own deadlines:</p>

<h2 id="development-tools">Development Tools</h2>
<p>To develop this project I needed to use a eries of different tools and programming languages:</p>

<h3 id="chartjs">Chart.JS</h3>

<p>After a discussion with my lecturer and some personal research, I decided to visualise the database data using Chart.JS, a JavaScript chart plugin. Although I had never used Chart.js before, having looked at the ‘Getting Started’ section of their site, I felt confident that I would be able to develop an aesthetically pleasing visual representation of the data gathered from the virtual guide section of the app.</p>

<p>As Lisa had said that the silk mill wanted to impress the HLF, I felt that applying the data to various different graphs would help to catch their attention. As well as this Chart.JS graphs come with prebuilt animations included as well as an easy system to change the color styling of select parts of the graphs. I thought that this would make the final product feel more polished and professional as the animations help to distract the user from the loading times of the HTML page and the easy styling methods would allow me to fit the page to Whitchurch Silk Mill’s brand.</p>

<h3 id="mysql">MySQL</h3>

<p>We had decided to develop our database using MySQL as we would be storing this on a basic internal server via the Rasberry Pi. Having never created a database before, I felt that there were plenty of MySQL tutorials available to me and so we chose to use this method. As well as this the language used to create queries in MySQL seemed fairly easy to pick up on a basic level, therefore I felt that I could learn it fast.</p>

<h3 id="html-css-and-js">HTML, CSS AND JS</h3>

<p>As we had decided to run our application off of an internal server via the Rasberry Pi and the system had to be accessible on mobile phones, we decided to use web languages to develop our application. As well as this both myself and Jack were quite confident about our knowledge of these languages.</p>

<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
<p>PHP is a server-side coding language for web development. From my research it was clear that I would need to use PHP as one of my development tools for this project. as well as this I would need it to connect to the MySQL database and link it to my evaluation page. Having never used PHP as a coding language, I felt that this would take the longest for me to get to grips with.</p>

<h2 id="initial-development">Initial Development</h2>

<h3 id="database">Database</h3>
<p>I began development by creating a database for our data to be collected in. During the first week, Jack worked alongside me to ensure that we both understood how the database would work and so that we both had a copy of the same table setup (Same names and types).</p>

<p>From our research we had found that we needed to set our ID row to ‘Primary’ as well as ‘AUTO_INCREMENT’, therefore, we implemented this into our database. ‘AUTO_INCREMENT’ is by default set to 1 and will increment by 1 for each new record. This is useful for the ID row as each visitor that is recorded in the database needs a unique ID. The Primary key is used to uniquely define a record. As there can only be one primary key in a table, it should be set to the most unique set of data within a record e.g. the ID so that each visitor can be defined.</p>

<p>We then created a TIMESTAMP for each record so that the silk mill can see the times in which different visitors attended the silk mill exhibitions.</p>

<p>Finally, we created the rest of the datasets that the silk mill needed to gather such as age, gender, country and exhibitions. For the prototype we limited the number of different exhibitions to 6 so that we could create a far fully fleshed out prototype.</p>

<p>Evaluation System - Version 1
Once Jack had mocked up a simple way of updating the database with information (through the virtual tour guide), it was my turn to begind developing a system that turned that data into graphs and charts.</p>

<p>To draw data from the database, we required a PHP document that connected our application to the MySQL database. This is then called at the start of each page of the application.</p>

<p>Having set up a connection to the database I then had to develop a way of pulling sets of data to implement into my Chart.JS charts. I began by creating a MySQL query that pulled all data from the ‘users’ database.</p>

<p>To set the data that I wanted to pull from the database I created an array of the rows that I needed. If the array is equal to the result, the query fetches the data from the database.</p>

<p>The result of this displays a string of data for each unique user. With the data pulled from the database, I was then able to call data.PHP in my Chart.JS page</p>

<p>I began my development by following a series of tutorials explaining how to import MySQL data into Chart.JS. Although, I quickly managed to create a very simple chart, I found it difficult to process and present the right data. Learning Chart,JS was not necessarily the problem, it was more that my MySQL queries were not sending the right information. I began troubleshooting my data.php file and messed around with my queries until I was able to represent the data that I wanted onto a graph.</p>

<p>I set the label dataset of the X-axis to take age from data.php. By doing this I was able to see each individual record across my X-axis with each exxhibit dataset along the Y-axis. However, the age dataset did not group people of similar ages. I experimented with my MySQL query and added ‘GROUP BY age’ to the end of this. This made visitors with the exact same age grouped onto my graph which was a slight improvement from what it previously was.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I still felt as if the chart was not up to standard. I tried creating a MySQL query that set age ranges, however, I could not get the query to work. It wasn’t until the last version of the evaluation system that I was able to define age groups rather than individual ages.</p>

<p>After many failed attempts to improve the quality of my chart data, I decided to focus my work on developing another, more basic, chart ready for our first evaluation. I attempted to develop a doughnut chart that represented the total number of times each exhibit had been visited.</p>

<p>After some research I came across the ‘SUM’ MySQL function, which adds together the number of a set row.</p>

<p>The result from data2.php presents the sum of each exhibit visit and looks like this.</p>

<p>After successfully developing two live-updating graphs, I felt that I had developed a good foundation to build my project from. However, it was still very clear that a lot of work needed to be done to ensure that the client was happy with the system.</p>

<p>Firstly, the first graph that I developed needed to be reworked to take age group data rather than display exhibition visits for every different age. Secondly, more data needed to be displayed onto the application to ensure that Whitchurch Silk Mill had enough evidence to show to the HLF. Finally, the system needed to be password protected so that only Whitchurch Silk Mill volunteers could have access to the confidential information displayed.</p>

<h3 id="crit-review-considerations">Crit Review Considerations</h3>
<p>During the first cohort crit review of our projects in week 8, I was given some feedback to help improve my final product:</p>

<p>Reconsider the design of the application
Add more data to be evaluated
Safeguard the information
I felt that this was really positive impact and decided to take it onboard ready for my week 10 crit review.</p>

<p>Reconsiderations and Development for Version 2
Design</p>

<p>As I am a development student, it was suggested that I speak to a design student about improving the look and brand of my application. I reached out to a close friend of mine studying a branding and typography course in London. Him and I had a Skype conversation where we looked at the branding and color schemes of Whitchurch Silk Mill’s website. After doing this, he suggested to me that I should consider setting the main purple color of their website to each ‘bar’ element of my charts and play around with the opacity of each.</p>

<p>As seen in the image, I feel that this improved the quality of my graphs and made the project feel more polished as the design fit the silk mills brand much more. As well as this I inverted the color scheme of the header as I felt that the purple background was too imposing.</p>

<h3 id="adding-more-data">Adding More Data</h3>
<p>Another set of feedback that I was given during the crit review was to add more data that could be evaluated by the volunteers. I began working on this by developinmg two more bar charts. One displaying exhibitions visited based on nationality and the other, exhibitions visited in relation to gender. I used a very similar query for both graphs where I simply grouped the data by ‘gender’ and ‘nationality’ with the ‘SUM’ of each exhibit.</p>

<p>To help the volunteers have access to quick general statistics I created infographic style counters that pulled stats from the database. I am personally really proud of this section of the project and I feel that the counters next to the graphs make the project feel more complete and polished.</p>

<p>The statistics pulled from the database use the ‘COUNT’ function in a MySQL query. For instance, to find the number of registered visitors, the number of ID’s was counted.</p>

<h3 id="safeguarding-information">Safeguarding Information</h3>

<p>The final piece of feedback I was given was to ensure that the evaluation software was protected so that only volunteers at the silk mill could access the data collected.</p>

<p>To do this, I created a basic password Javascript script that required a user to login to access the evaluation software. Although this system worked, I had noticed that anyone could find the password in the script through the inspect function on a webpage. This meant that the password was not secure at all. I decided to try and find a way of encrypting the password so that it would not be visible inside of the inspector. I began researching into htaccess and php login pages where passwords would be stored inside of databases.</p>

<p>The problem with this was that, I would have to backtrack my work and develop an entirely new login system which I felt would set my progress back. Eventually, I came across another way of hiding my password. The solution to my problem was to obfuscate my script. This method jumbled my JS code into a more obscure format. Although, this is not the most complex safeguarding system, I believed that this was complex enough for the prototype we were developing. I feel that this was an important addition to my project as data security is extremely important in today’s society.</p>

<h2 id="version-2">Version 2</h2>

<p>Having made these changes I ready for the crit review, the feedback was far more positive. However, it was noticed that I had not developed a redirectory system for my evaluation system. This meant that users could directly bypass the login page and have full access to the data collected through our application. I was extremely glad that this was pointed out as it was something that I had overlooked during my development.</p>

<p>Changes, Fixes and Development for Final Product
Having considered the feedback during the week 10 crit revue. It was clear that I had to re-evaluate my safeguarding system. I began by looking at ways of redirecting my page unless a user had logged in.</p>

<p>I ended up developing a system using PHP where, through the use of sessions and defining ‘current’ and ‘last page’, I was able to check whether or not a use has accessed the page before. After this an ‘if’ statement is called that redirects the user from the evaluation page if they have not successfully logged in through the login page</p>

<p>I was really happy with how well this system worked. No matter how i tried to gain access to the page I would always be redirected back to the login page. I think that this really strengthened the safeguarding system I had in place. With this system now in place, and more time left to experiment with the project, I decided to have a look at other areas I could strengthen.</p>

<h3 id="rebuilding-age-chart">Rebuilding Age Chart</h3>
<p>After leaving the age chart from version 1 of my project, having not been able to group by age group, I decided to return to it in the hope that I could improve it. After some experimenting, I decided to edit Jack’s form system on the virtual tour guide as well as the database so that the user could pick from a series of age groups rather than write their exact age. I then set the database age row to ‘VARCHAR’ instead of an integer so that the data would display properly. This made the age graph look far more polished and Jack was happy with the changes that I made</p>

<h3 id="csv-exporting">CSV Exporting</h3>
<p>To strenthen my project even further and to improve the evaluation system for the volunteers at the silk mill, I decided to create a CSV exporting system, where volunteers could see all of the rows of data on the database and export them to an Excel document.</p>

<p>To create this, I developed a system that gathered the database data into an array and then echoed it into a table on the page. To export the data I created a form that posted the data to download.php. Download.php then downloads the data to a file called users.csv.</p>

<p>I think that this addition to the system will be really helpful for the volunteers at the silk mill as they will be able to have easy access to all of the data that our virtual guide will collect. As well as this I feel that it adds a very professional and complete feel to the project.</p>

<h2 id="final-product">Final Product</h2>
<p>I am extremely happy with the final product (seen in the video at the top of the page) for this project. Although learning new softwares and coding languages was challenging at times, I believe that I have learnt large amount about developing back-end softwares. I think that myself and Jack worked extremely well as a team and helped each other to learn for the duration of the project. In terms of the goals that I had at the start of the project, I believe that I have achieved all but one of them. To complete final goal we will need to discuss the project with Zoe at the end of year show.</p>

<p>For this project I was very concious of managing my time wisely, therefore I managed to stick to my scheduling plan very well. I think that this increased my productivity over the duration of the project</p>
